## Building a deep neural network (in python) and using it for cat/non-cat image classification

In this project we will buid a Deep Neural Network (L-layers) from skratch. This project is divided into two phases.

Phase 1: We will implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
Phase 2: In this phase we will use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.

This project is to learn:

 - Non-linear units like ReLU to improve neural network model
 - Build a deep neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
 - Apply deep neural network for supervised learning and classification
